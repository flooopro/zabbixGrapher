# zabbixGrapher
* CHANGES IN THIS FORK: changed grapher.js to grapher.js.php (The zbx_sessionid is dyn. included by PHP)
This should solve the problem with the httponly-flag.

This is one page js application for quick search/view zabbix graphs, dinamically graph any collected item
* First step is to select host, just start typing HostGroup name or Hostname
![Host](https://habrastorage.org/files/f00/e9b/aa9/f00e9baa94654dd7a4b21f3aab706661.png)  
If you choose one Host - all its graphs would start drawing right away (quick host overview supposed).  
If you select multiple Hosts - no graphs would be drawn (manual comparison supposed) and you can draw graphs for all selected Hosts by clicking `Select All`  
![Graphs](https://habrastorage.org/files/8fc/2ce/36d/8fc2ce36d1814b4fa5a1820405b1b58e.png)  
* You can also draw any items from selected hosts on single graph  
Select items in interest and then click to create either `Normal` or `Stacked` graph  
![Items](https://habrastorage.org/files/698/3e6/3cd/6983e63cd4f54d879f79148383f756ef.png)  
* Time Zooming using usual Zabbix timeline and area selection on graphs supported
* You can click group name in list to select/deselect all subitems ("Filesystems" in screenshot above)
* To share selected Graphs just copy and send the URL (it dynamically updated with current state)

##### Installation
Unzip to root of your zabbix-web folder (Note: `master` branch is for Zabbix 3.0, use `zabbix2.4` branch for older versions).  
Then add to `Main Menu` with something like this:
```diff

```
After Installation you could realise that your zabbix-fronted is not powerful enough to render so many images on one page at once. If so - check out this caching story: http://blog.sepa.spb.ru/2016/01/speed-up-zabbix-graphs-with-nginx.html

##### Options
You can tweak some options in the beginning of `grapher.js` file. Please verify URL, if your Zabbix installed to /zabbix it should be `url: '/zabbix/api_jsonrpc.php'`
```js
// main ---------------------------------------------------------------------
jQuery(function() {
  var options = {
    url: '/api_jsonrpc.php',            // zabbix API url
    timeout: 5000,                      // to API in msec
    <?php
        echo 'ssid: \'' . htmlspecialchars($_COOKIE["zbx_sessionid"]) . '\', // key to API, get from current logged in user';
    ?>

    pagelen: 24,                        // graphs per page
    width: 600,                         // of graph
    height: 200                         // of graph
  },
```
